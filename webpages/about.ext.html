        <h3><span class="text-muted">The Good old Days</span></h3>
        <p class="lead1"> Celebrating birthdays is my favorite thing to do back then. I am that child who loves to have cake and toys in every birthdays. My childhood is very great and for me it is my most precious moments in life. Everything was good back then, I can do so many things like drawing, reading books, watching movies, playing outdoors and I sleep between 7-8pm then wakes 5-6am. I may be stubborn sometimes but I am a rule-follower. I love learning new things back then, I explore every edge in our sitio that even its 12:00 in the afternoon I still want to go out and I guess it's the reason why my skin became brown. Everyone that sorrounds me loves me very much and I can really feel it. I miss everyone in my childhood including the child version of me and I will never forget them.</p>

        <h3> <span class="text-mutes">The Second Wave</span></h3>
        <p class="lead2">My teenage life began at the age of Thirteen. On the first day of class in grade 7, I was very behave and only talks during attendance. My grade 7 classmates were the same until we reach grade 10 which is the final year in junior high and because of that I became friends with all of them but I have this circle of friends that I still have until now and Im great to have them. I explored so much when I was a teen, I had girlfriend but only last 3months, I drank my first beer at the age of 15, and I also started lying to my parents for some reasons. My teenage life is full of good and bad experiences but because of those experiences I became who I am now.</p>
