        <p class="lead">My father's name is <strong>Philip Carcosa Carreon</strong>, while my mother's name is <strong>Liezel Llausas Carreon</strong>. I am their eldest son and I have 3 siblings namely <strong>Philip Zeu Carreon</strong> the 2nd child, <strong>Mc Philip Neo Carreon</strong> the 3rd one and <strong>Yesha Liezel Carreon</strong> the only daughter and the youngest child.</p>

        <p class="lead">I am Kent Phillip Llausas Carreon, my friends usually calls me "Kaken". Born in Carcosa Compound, Singapore, Balulang, Cagayan de Oro City and also lives there. I am 19 years old, 154cm tall and weigh 50kg. Loves color black, cats, ice cream, rambutan and plays a lot of video games.</p>
        <p class="lead">I have different personality for my different circle of friends and even for my family but most likely I am what people call nowadays "Ambivert", a person whose personality has a balance of extrovert and introvert features. I love going to peaceful places especially when associated with nature most likely when the scene reminds me of my childhood. I love my childhood very much because of the happiness I have at that time, because I can really feel the love people gave me and the beautiful and lovely sorroundings. But now that I am already a teenager and slowly realizing what life is all about. I see life as a game, a game where winning does really matter. But for me it's not all the time that after winning you will be happy, not all the time you lose you will be sad. There are times these are opposite that if you win you will feel sad, or if  you lose you became happy and vice versa. For me as long as I'm still standing, I will never let myself be defeated nor I will let my self be sad. But winning is not the key for this, finding true peace is. I am still far from what I want in life, but I am also far from where I started.</p>

        <p class="lead">People said that you are the holder of your future, but no one know what does the future holds. I have many dreams and ambitions such as; I want to be financially stable that my parents will just eat, sleep, relax and repeat and that even God will use my pocket to help others, I also wants to travel from the different countries around the world, and marry the girl that makes my world beautiful and have three kids with her. I want success in life and at the same time with happiness.</p>
        <p class="lead">I really wonder what my future is, but for now I will not think of it that much because as they say that yesterday is a history and tomorrow is a mystery, but today is a "gift" that is why it is called the present. And I will do my best to survive and see what my future holds.</p>
